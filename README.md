# go-haystack

Command line tool to generate keys as used by [OpenHaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack)

Specifically for use with [macless-haystack](https://github.com/dchristl/macless-haystack)

Right does what https://github.com/biemster/FindMy/blob/main/generate_keys.py does but in Go.

## How to use

```shell
go run .
```

## TODO

- generate the actual .keys file
- generate .json file that can be use by macless-haystack
- add instructions on how to use
